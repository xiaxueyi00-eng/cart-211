            <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
            <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the experiences
                of war
                and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer, profoundly
                shaped
                his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to read
                and
                write.</p>

            <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn
                College, followed
                by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>

            <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
            <p>Their first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection Night Sky with Exit
                Wounds
                (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam Warâ€™s legacy,
                migration,
                queer identity, and the fragility of language.</p>
