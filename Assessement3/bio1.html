            <h3>Career</h3>
            <article>
                <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family
                    marked by the
                    experiences
                    of war
                    and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former
                    rice farmer,
                    profoundly
                    shaped
                    his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his
                    family to learn
                    how to read
                    and
                    write.</p>

                <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in
                    English from
                    Brooklyn
                    College, followed
                    by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>

                <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
                <p>Their first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the
                    collection Night
                    Sky with Exit
                    Wounds
                    (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of
                    the Vietnam
                    Warâ€™s legacy,
                    migration,
                    queer identity, and the fragility of language.</p>
