                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ocean Vuong emigrated from Vietnam to the United States when he was two years old. His early
                        experiences
                        shaped his literary voice.

                        <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                        <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the
                            experiences
                            of war
                            and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer,
                            profoundly
                            shaped
                            his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn
                            how to read
                            and
                            write.</p>

                        <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from
                            Brooklyn
                            College, followed
                            by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>

                        <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
                        <p>Their first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection Night
                            Sky with Exit
                            Wounds
                            (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam
                            Warâ€™s legacy,
                            migration,
                            queer identity, and the fragility of language.</p>
