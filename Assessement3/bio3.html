        <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
        <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the experiences
            of war and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer,
            profoundly shaped his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to
            learn how to read and write.</p>
        <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn
            College, followed by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>

        <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
        <p>Their first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection <em>Night Sky with
                Exit Wounds</em> (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the
            Vietnam Warâ€™s legacy, migration, queer identity, and the fragility of language.</p>
