                <h3>Life & Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Ocean Vuong is celebrated for his lyrical and powerful writing, blending poetry and narrative with
                    deep emotion. His works explore war, migration, queerness, and the resilience of the human spirit.

                    <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                    <p>After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the
                        experiences
                        of war
                        and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer,
                        profoundly
                        shaped
                        his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how
                        to read
                        and
                        write.</p>

                    <p>They studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from
                        Brooklyn
                        College, followed
                        by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.</p>

                    <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
                    <p>Their first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection Night Sky
                        with Exit
                        Wounds
                        (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam Warâ€™s
                        legacy,
                        migration,
                        queer identity, and the fragility of language.</p>
